# Assignment 1
The Knapsack Problem (BKP) is a crucial challenge within combinatorial optimization. To solve complex search problems, it introduces weight and benefits to maximize utility within some given constraints.

### Objective:

This task presents you with items, each represented by distinct weights and benefits. The task entails determining the optimal assortment of items to fill a knapsack, ensuring the total weight does not exceed the knapsack's capacity while maximizing the overall benefit. This assignment explicitly addresses the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, where each item can be included once or excluded altogether.

### Item representation:

The items for consideration are detailed in the document "assignment 1 knapsack.txt" and are accessible through Canvas. Below is a representation of how items are detailed:

| Item ID | Benefit (b) | Weight (w) |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1       | 20          | 15         |
| 2       | 40          | 32         |
| ...     | ...         | ...        |


### Task Overview:

Your task is to employ Breadth-first Search (BFS) and Depth-first Search (DFS) methodologies to unearth the optimal combination of items. These strategies necessitate conceptualizing a tree, navigated with a queue (BFS) or a stack (DFS) to explore potential item combinations. After implementing these two search strategies, you are supposed to present them to a lab assistant. **(1 point awarded per codebase)**.

### Pre-conditions in order to present your code:
- Each codebase must demonstrate efficiency by executing in under 0.5 seconds. If this criterion is unmet, consult with a lab assistant for potential resolutions.
- Implementation must utilize a queue or stack (or an array-based simulation) in alignment with the chosen search strategy.

### Your report has to cover the key parts as follows:
1. - Explanation of the problem. (2 point)
        - Give the representation of a solution (answer) of the problem, as explained during the course. (0.5)
        - Give the equation of the objective function (what we want to maximize). (0.5)
        - Give the equation for the restriction(s) of the problem. (0.5)
        - What is the branching factor (b) and the maximum depth (m)? Give an explanation of your answer. (0.5)
2. -  Comparison of the algorithms. (1 point)
        - Comparison of the time expended by the algorithms. (0.5)
        - Comparison of the space used in memory at a time by the algorithms. (0.5)

### Conditions to approve the assignment 1

In order to receive the points for the code, you need to submit the report and have more than half of
the points. Example: If a report has 1 point, then you need to have a minimum of 0.5.
- Minimum score to pass assignment 1: 3 points.

- SCORES 3-5
    - Your score < 3: U
    - 3 <= your score <= 3.75: 3
    - 3.75 < your score < 4.75: 4
    - 4.75 <= your score: 5
- SCORES A-F
    - Your score < 3: F
    - 3 <= your score < 3.4: E
    - 3.4 <= your score < 3.8: D
    - 3.8 <= your score < 4.2: C
    - 4.2 <= your score < 4.6: B
    - 4.6 <= your score: A

### Submission details
**Maximum Score:** 5 points.

**Time to submit:** 4 April â€“ 4 June & 27 June & 14 August

**I will not consider a submission without the following format:**
File names for the submission:
StudentName_StudentLastName_Assignment1_Code.zip (Only by email)
StudentName_StudentLastName_Assignment1_Report.pdf (Only in canvas)

Email subject for the submission:
[DVA251] StudentName StudentLastName Assignment1 Code

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION!**

You are allowed to send each assignment a maximum of three times. When you approve the assignment, you are not allowed to submit the assignment again.

Before defending the code to Miguel Leon, you have to send the code by email to johan.hjorth@mdu.se or jonatan.tidare@mdu.se.

Before submitting the report, you should present this assignment first to a lab assistant. After that, and
only if everything is correct, you may submit the report in canvas.

You cannot get the points of the report without presenting the code first.
