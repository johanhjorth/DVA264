## Course Goals
The course aims to establish a foundational understanding of artificial intelligence through theoretical and practical approaches. It also seeks to explore case studies in related areas.

## Learning Objectives
After completing the course, the student shall be able to: 

1. define a problem and its search space, as well as understand how different representations of the problem, based on states, can improve the performance of an algorithm that solves the problem,  
2. apply the most representative uninformed search strategies in a state search space and analyze their efficiency in time and space,  
3. apply the most representative informed search strategies in a state search space and analyze the consequences of heuristic functions on time and space efficiency,  
4. understand how to solve a constraint satisfaction problem and apply algorithms to deal with constraints,  
5. apply well-known optimization techniques,
6. use adversarial search techniques and understand their relation to games,  
7. analyze a given problem, evaluate if it can be addressed by an algorithm that is reviewed  in this course, and also
8. Carry out an ethics and gender equality analysis of data and its impact on an AI system

## Topics covered
- Lecture 1: Introduction to AI
- Lecture 2: Definition of problems
- Lecture 3: Solving Problems by Searching I: Uninformed search algorithms
- Lecture 4: Solving Problems by Searching II: Informed Search Algorithms
- Lecture 5: Backtracking
- Lecture 6: Local search methods
- Lecture 7: Adversarial Search
- Lecture 8: Ethics and gender equality

## Assignments and grading
The course includes four laboratory works (LAB1 to LAB4), each focusing on specific learning objectives. Assignments are graded Fail (U), 3, 4, or 5, with details provided in the course materials.
- **LAB1:** Covers learning objectives 1, 2, 3, and 7. (2 credits)
- **LAB2:** Focuses on objectives 1, 4, and 7. (1.5 credits)
- **LAB3:** Addresses objectives 1, 5, 7, and 8. (2.5 credits)
Part A: Code - Involves using a heart disease dataset to apply machine learning techniques for feature selection, explicitly focusing on random-restart hill climbing and random-restart variable neighbor search. The goal is to improve the performance of a K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier. Students are required to present their code for evaluation.
Part B: Report and Seminar (In Swedish) - This part requires an ethical and gender analysis of the dataset used in Part A, culminating in a report. It emphasizes the importance of understanding data biases and ensuring fairness in machine learning applications.
- **LAB4:** covers objectives 1, 6, and 7. (1.5 credits)

### Each of the labs requires:
- An assignment that is presented with a report and a
- demonstration to the teacher

 

Assignment 1: Solving problems by searching (Lectures 2 and 3) (LAB1, 2 hp)

Assignment 2: Constraint satisfaction problems (Lectures 2 and 5)  (LAB2, 1.5 hp)

Assignment 3: Local search methods (Lectures 6 and 8) (LAB3, 2.5 hp)

Assignment 4: Adversarial Search (Lecture 7) (LAB4, 1.5 hp)

Each assignment will be evaluated from 0 to 5 points. The assignment description provides more information.

Conversion of points to grades will be converted as follows:

* **SCORES 3-5**
    * Your score < 3: U
    * 3 <= your score <= 3.75: 3
    * 3.75 < your score < 4.75: 4
    * 4.75 <= your score: 5
* **SCORES A-F**
    * Your score < 3: F
    * 3 <= your score < 3.4: E
    * 3.4 <= your score < 3.8: D
    * 3.8 <= your score < 4.2: C
    * 4.2 <= your score < 4.6: B
    * 4.6 <= your score: A

The final grade is the average of all lab scores, requiring a minimum grade of 3 for approval.


You may use any programming language of your choice. However, you should be aware that the teachers will only help you with syntax in Python.

For every lab (1-4), the student must defend their code to the teacher before sending the report (1-2 pages).

Maximum planned work per assignment:

* Assignment 1:
    * Lab sessions 1 and 2
    * work at home: 10 h
* Assignment 2:
    * Lab sessions 3 and 4
    * work at home 10 h
* Assignment 3:
    * Lab sessions 5 and 6
    * work at home for 20 h
* Assignment 4:
    * Lab sessions 7 and 8
    * work at home 10 h


Remember that the assignments are individual, so try to think and solve the problems yourself. Doing it this way will teach you much more than getting help from another student.

## Pre-requisites
The student should have finished the following courses:
- DVA128 Programmering med Python

- DVA245 Datastrukturer, algoritmer och programkonstruktion med Python

## Cheating
**DO NOT COPY!**
If someone copies, they will fail. If two or more people are involved, all of them will fail.

Using codes from the internet or students from previous years is not allowed.

## Learning Process
The course is a Lecture-based course, in which, each week, we will have a lecture where:  

* The lectures are discussion-based and require hands-on student involvement.
* Together, we try out and discuss different solutions for the presented problems
* Also, at the end of the lecture, some reading materials will be given to you. By reading this material, you can better understand the specific topic. Also, some extra reading can be found from that source. Assessing the extra reading will give you a broader knowledge of the area and a different point of view.

If you have any questions about the lectures, please contact me by [email](johan.hjorth@mdu.se).
